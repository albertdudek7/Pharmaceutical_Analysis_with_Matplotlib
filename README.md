# Pharmaceutical Analysis with Matplotlib

Conducting analysis on a fictional new pharmaceutical company, Pymaceuticals, that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

Granted access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

Tasks include tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. As well as a top-level summary of the study results.

Preparing the data.
